* make image size input arguments with min and max values

* make the installer compatible with other linux systems

* make a minimised image and share it

* software tests

* improve the installer: warn for failed downloads (BVLC specifically)
    (maybe host a copy of these files)

* add other training data sets

* make a best-of image gallery, invite users to post images (make a contest???)
